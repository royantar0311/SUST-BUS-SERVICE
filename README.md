# SUST-BUS-SERVICE
First Project of my undergraduate life. It is a team Project

As a part of our level 2 term 1 Object Oriented Language course(Java) we developed this app on Android platform.

Idea: A real-time tracking system of Bus Service, SUST. Users can track buses on the roads of Sylhet city. Used GoogleMaps Api to get the location of the bus, having a GPS device installed in it. for safety, anyone trying to access the location service must log in.
So there is an authentication system. To ensure users from campus only, University Student ID card verification is there.

Description: Both Drivers and Student can use the same app module. Everydays schedule will be set from the admin panel (university administration). Drivers start sharing their ride selecting their destination.
Users can get real time location of those buses. For anyone want to get on a bus from any point of Sylhet city, this is going to be very useful. and for their feasibility a notification system is also there. It works like an alarm, whenever bus gets closer to a previously selected point of the city, he/she will be notified.
